# 15-puzzle-game
A sliding puzzle, sliding block puzzle, or sliding tile puzzle is a combination puzzle that challenges a player to slide (frequently flat) pieces along certain routes (usually on a board) to establish a certain end-configuration.

This algorithm solves a 15 puzzle game using heuristic functions manhattan distance and linear conflict.
The results (time and number of moves) depends on the accuracy variable. The more accuracy is set, the number of moves reduces but the time increases. You can set the accuracy from 0-100.
